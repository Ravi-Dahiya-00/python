## About Me
Hi, I'm **Ravi Dahiya**, a passionate Python developer. I'm currently studying Computer Science and am focused on improving my skills in Python programming. This repository reflects my journey from mastering the basics of Python to working on projects that integrate multiple concepts. My goal is to learn, build, and grow while contributing to the Python community.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. **Voice Assistant in Python**  
   - A simple voice assistant using `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries to perform basic tasks like telling the time, opening apps, and answering questions.
   - **Technologies:** Python, `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`

2. **Basic Python Exercises**  
   - A collection of simple exercises to help practice core concepts like loops, functions, and conditionals.

3. **File Handling in Python**  
   - A project that demonstrates how to read, write, and manipulate files in Python.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python**  
   - An introduction to OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python.
   - **Technologies:** Python, OOP principles

## Skills
- **Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS
- **Libraries:** `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `os`, `datetime`, `requests`
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code
- **Concepts:** Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, File Handling
